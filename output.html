<p class="text_obisnuit2">The Artist’s Eyes Are Subordinated To Affective Values</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">The perceived element tends to manifest itself in your reality, often through a transfiguring perception of it.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">If the eye knows how to see, then the mind can grasp the concrete, and the heart is refreshed like a flower that feeds on light. Especially when I am on vacation at the seaside, relaxed, in a good mood, refreshed by the feeling of a mysterious harmony between depth and purity, then the mind works best, because the eye no longer tries to observe, but really admires, recognizes the pure beauty in the painting a world reborn from light. The affective values attributed to the place where I am, confronting them with a restricted expressive element, such as peace or fulfillment, hide behind an image full of meaning Atalyente Dimielasarr Esotrenthis, a moment of self-discovery, of faith, of memories.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I see the sea, I hear the sound of the waves in a place where details matter, and I feel the salty smell of water that seems to replace the air, which instantly relaxes you, eliminating tension, irritability and restlessness, at least in the short term. And this helps me form a broader picture in approaching the artistic phenomenon, because painting is not only drawing and color, vision and perspective, but represents the extension of a sense strongly connected to life.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">If my eyes are subordinated to the affective values that the place where I am builds, without feeling any tension release as the brain gets used to visualizing images that encourage relaxation, then the creative process takes place spontaneously and automatically.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">And what are affective values? What do they represent in a moment of receiving an impression that changes the movements of the soul, similar to the construction of a poem that finds, above all, the combustion necessary to burn within itself?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Do you use the image of figures that become metaphors, to feed your self permeated by the need to express an emotional state?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Affective values are the pillars of recalling an amazing number of very deep sensations and therefore, they are related to the existence of synesthesia, that is, the simultaneous perception of a set of auditory, visual, olfactory elements. Besides that, the affective values, ferried in a certain spiritual density, so without remaining closed in the tiring rigor of an ordinary thought, belong to the manifestation of the Brush-Ink couple, associated with the vital breaths Yin-Yang.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Of course, it’s not just about abstractions, benchmarks with general “value”, indices that represent the level of consciousness, emotional and psychic development. In particular, the affective values are the result of the awareness of that serene, reconciled state of mind, permeated as if by the mystery of eternal things that surrounds the artist.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Let me list some affective values found in an artist: purity, idealization, appreciation, introspection, fulfillment, satisfaction, attachment, enlightenment, delicacy, exaltation, dedication.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">All this eases my need for complete rest, prolonged by the sea in a soothing ambience, enriched with the relaxing experience of viewing an enchanting sunset, a sphere of light colored in a splendid red-orange, projected on the plane of a horizon that transforms any painting into a closed universe, perfect and self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I still wonder if nature has not created this moment of sweet respiro especially for me, so that I can more easily enter into communion with the divinity, so that I can turn the present into a timeless space of bliss and serenity, in a unique design where memories will come alive again.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can the image on which you focus your attention highlight the existence of synesthesia in a natural setting that remains unaffected by the passage of time?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Indeed, the eyes perceive the observable image in a time horizon close to it, passing horizontally through a path that goes up to the “first common superior” and then back down to the plane of real retrospection of authentic experiences. However, the sensation of a “persistent but discreet smell” can provide a framework that transmits feelings. The smell of the sea respects my emotional values, it does not withdraw from me the feeling of soulful fulfillment that characterized the well-known painter Nicolae Grigorescu, in the view of the writer Alexandru Vlahuţă:</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">“Grigorescu did not seek to solve problems, nor to preach. After all, he did not seek anything. From the multitude of soothing moments, from the multitude of impressions, from the fecund powers of his life, a part of himself, a cleaner, more luminous, more worthy of the realm of poetry. This, and only this, became painting.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">And now I remember the sea, with its strong waves, it seemed endless when I watched it from the shore. But since I could not see the space beyond the edge of the observable horizon, I could not know whether the size of the image that was attracting my attention, in its totality, was finite or exhaustible. The sea breeze, the salty smell, the relaxation and the days of rest on the beach, were the assets that brought me to the present state. Be that as it may, every day spent at the seaside was a moment of rediscovery, of unique emotions, of return and, last but not least, of memories.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">There are some special moments that deserve to be kept for a long time not only in memory, but also in color…</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I still wonder: why did my eyes look at the sea with such affection, forgetting anything and everything? Because the sea also looked at me with the same affection, and from her look I understood that she felt the same. As if, looking at me, she wanted to forget all the vanity of this world. Looking at her longingly, she said something to me before I left, but so that only I could hear:</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">- On that fine sand that washes away with one breath, only one man, an artist endowed with aesthetic power, left visible, irreplaceable traces. I took the tracks back, just to be sure that he will return to me, and then he will reveal to me what purity, perfection, eternity, peace is, associating them with the image of other colors.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership has in its composition the soul’s need to transcend, to contemplate the spiritual beauty, and to integrate into a whole all the moments that are realized through creation.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">The Artist’s Eyes Are Subordinate To Affective Values </span>if you consider the following aspect: you have to go through all the “impermanent” moods if you want to truly experience a sublime moment. These eyes know how to see, as in clear water, everything that comes to the surface with passion, beyond any honest reasoning, in an artistic image: that inner light that connects you to everything and brings you inner peace, that ecstasy of the soul drunk with freedom.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">This inner light will also shine on the outside, in a painting made in water colors.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">The Affective Values Of Artists</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">The way the painter expresses himself in the use of the brush technique serves as an argument to give his features a certain depth and subtlety in a theme that includes the most meaningful human emotions and experiences.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">This fragment from Alexandru Vlahuţă’s book is emotional, because it has something magical, a special view, a place of a story where you get lost and find yourself at the same time, a well-individualized space maintained with that sensitivity of a painter who outlines the experiences with expressiveness, with emotion, with delicacy and subtlety.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Nicolae Grigorescu was, in his own way, very cold. Winter was whiter than the grave to him. He rents a workshop in Paris. He had collected, from so many travels, a lot of art things: old furniture from Normandy, tapestries, oriental fabrics, carpets, weapons, dishes, and, with his gift of enlivening things by the way he knew how to group them, harmonize them between themselves, he created an artistic interior, of peace and dream, where everything spoke softly, with a voice from another time.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The poet of peace, kindness and gentleness, the poet of light and the blue sky is called to sing the darkness and the storm of death, to find on his palette the colors for the most terrible sight that the still untamed wilderness of the human race can present. And there was no painter in the world who could have found them better than him. It seems that all his life he had done nothing but this. Along with the soldiers, facing death, he watched almost all the atrocities of the war, he understood who the real heroes were, and he devoted all the love and all the admiration of his soul to them; them, those dry and hearty peasants, who threw themselves frantically into the arms of death, they, above all, were immortalized in his powerful work – the most moving epic of the bravery of our nation. Yes. Those were his brothers.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">And how they were alike him ! Good brothers, like him, putting their whole soul into what they were doing, working hard, fighting hard, sacrificing themselves, without any thought of reward, feeling at all times, over their destiny, a coming commandment further on. And he commands more fiercely than the one that the circumstances call for. Faced with the terrible tragedy of the war, a new painter was waking up in Grigorescu.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Does your creation reflect those states given by situations or circumstances that shed light on the concrete content of your thinking and that impress a certain gravity, a certain character, a certain coloration and own meaning?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Affective values, through a psychological theme, therefore characterized by a free aesthetic consciousness, represent a category of values that show the emotional or affective state of a person in accordance with certain things, ideas, behaviors or circumstances. You must take these into account in order to be able to devote yourself fully, without obstacles, to the vocation that you enliven with talent and imagination, with artistic mastery, giving it life.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">These values, rare and honest, may vary by artist, depending on the work allocated to the act of creation, reflecting the artist’s preferences and subjective assessments of composition and balance. Positive or negative, unusual or unexpectedly broad, the affective values I will talk about next can influence the attitudes and behaviors of artists, especially if I take into account their preferences and subjective evaluations for the depth of perspectives they offer.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">For example, if a painter attributes a positive affective value to his connection to art, the kinship between the brush and color, he will have a favorable attitude towards the environment and towards the theme addressed, seeking to spend more time in the middle of nature, than with friends. On the other hand, if he attributes a negative affective value to kitsch, to the falsity with which art is treated, then he will have a negative attitude towards lies, such as the images “on the packaging”, and will thus avoid being surrounded by “advertisements”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Indeed, the affective values with which the artist is endowed can be influenced by the life experiences, the social environment, the education and the culture in which he grew up and with which he has interwoven his spiritual needs, they can also be the subject of change and evolution during his life (with whom he agrees to make a pact of great spiritual and divine closeness at the same time). In other words, affective values represent the subjective and emotional evaluations that the artist attributes to some aspects of his life, having a significant influence on the behavior and on the choices he makes to become more creative, more idealistic in terms of the capacity of art to bring positive change to the world.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can the image that your creation reflects fascinate viewers if your personal image itself preserves the traces of the emotional life prior to the subject transposed on the canvas?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">A true painter can base his work and creations on a wide variety of affective values inclined towards the use of subtlety in painting, without which the risk of falling into gross caricature would have been enormous. Below are just a few examples of affective values that a painter may hold, in a majority percentage, although the importance and priorities of making works may vary from one artist to another, depending on experiences, interests and individual perspectives.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Aesthetic appreciation: </span>A painter of great finesse especially appreciates the harmony and beauty arising from the act of creation. He seeks to produce unique works that appeal from an aesthetic point of view and that provide visual and emotional pleasure, especially through an overall environment dominated by tranquility and harmony.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Personal expression: </span>The ability of the painter to express his emotions, thoughts and visions through the use of colors, shapes and composition, in a symbolism with hidden meanings, is perhaps the greatest value of his art. I say this because everything the painter has to share is made up of his most immediate experiences, wanderings and passions. In this way, the painter tries to convey his artistic identity and his authenticity in the works made as “novelty”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Emotional communication: </span>A skilled painter succeeds in expressing intense feelings and causing affective reactions in the public, only if the personal image preserves the traces of the emotional life prior to the subject he is addressing. Often, he uses light, colors and other artistic elements to convey joy, sadness, melancholy or amazement, knowing that any interpretation of the painting requires complicity on the part of the viewer.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Exploration and experimentation: </span>A painter can show exploration and experimentation in his art, meaning that he is able to take a surprising and open approach to the artistic process, seeking new directions, techniques, styles or themes. Wanting to expand his limits and discover new ways of expression, the painter must leave his comfort zone and explore new possibilities and ideas in his artistic works, so that he can more easily cross the dividing line between realistic, abstract and impressionist style.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Social and cultural impact: </span>A painter of great finesse appreciates the ability of art to convey powerful messages and cause social change, especially when the message is repeated a great number of times in his works. Through his creative work he seeks to address social, political or cultural issues and inspire reflection and awareness in his viewers, provided he does not soar too far in his “madness” to distant planets and worlds.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">The sensitivity and the story of the place: </span>Indeed, the ability to observe and represent moods in works that suggest a certain perspective on the transformation of man into an emotional mirror, into an aesthetic expression of the soul, interweaving the reality of faces in a symphony of colors. Moreover, the painter cultivates the sensitivity and ability to detach, know and understand the beauty of nature, not only the secret life of individuals, because man cannot fully understand himself without the connection with nature, especially in a painted story.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Empathy and fostering dialogue: </span>An excellent artist seeks to bring out his capacity to feel and connect emotionally with others through an explicit affective attitude towards his expressive potential (through the possibilities of expressing his creativity, emotions, thoughts and personal vision in his artistic works).</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Through the dialogue between vibrant and subtle colors, expressive lines and flowing forms, light effects and mysterious shadows, the painter seeks to convey deep emotions and provide an authentic emotional experience to his viewers, expressing his understanding and compassion for the human condition through the art of turning the mixture of pictorial elements into a captivating visual harmony.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership represents that exchange of values between you and your creation, from which the interpretation of the work of art becomes a captivating journey in the world of sensations and emotions, but also a guide to introspection and self-discovery.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">Affective Values </span>have a major impact, either positive or negative, on the way the painter perceives himself, compared to the world around him. So, here I mean “self-perception” – the way the painter perceives himself and the world is a very complex aspect of the painter’s psychology. It seems to be related to the attitude and motivation with which he insists on highlighting a subject meant to trouble the minds of the viewers.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">In general, if you really believe that friendship is important to you, and that it should be an open circle towards all humanity to include all people as brothers, then you will seek to spend time with certain friends. And conversely, if you consider that lying has a negative affective value, so it cannot be incorporated into a picture by means of metaphor, then you will develop a negative attitude towards lying and towards lying people, and you will certainly avoid “lying” to reality in your creations.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Therefore, affective values represent a category of values that show the emotional or affective state of a person in relation to certain subjects, things, ideas, behaviors or circumstances, all of which are part of the arsenal of one’s own free decision to communicate one’s work to the public in an original way. These fairly pronounced values, realistic, devoted to a particular perspective, can vary depending on the person and reflect the painter’s subjective preferences and evaluations for portraiture, illustrating strong emotions and inner connections between him and the subject.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">See Me With The Eyes Of The Senses</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Sight can influence the viewed element only if it contributes, directly, to the shaping of your experiences.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I was on vacation in Greece. Always beautiful, always welcoming, with spectacular landscapes, the Ionian Sea delighted my eyes so much that I could only look at it, without caring about time or exposure to the sun. And I looked at her with that serene look, directed inward, understanding my freedom, the state of mind coming as if from the painter’s unitary consciousness, which manifests that mysterious connection between everything that means creation and detachment from everyday life.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">It also has its great life, its special grace, just as the painter has the science of working on the palette, of obtaining the pigmentary qualities in advance through multiple mixtures. And I think that nothing matters more than seeing it again with the eyes of the mind and with a clear mind. I see her again with a vivid tone, to talk to her, to photograph her, to feel her breeze with that touch of the past that repeats itself, having an exemplary value for the present. To be so close to her that I can smell her, hear the sound of the waves rolling on the shore, feel the water caressing my feet as it wipes away my footprints on the sand.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Without realizing it, the painter’s palette was enriched with particularly inspired, poetic means of expression, in terms of color and drawing, giving rise to the “always new” type effect produced by a creation extended to a new horizon. Moreover, by mixing the blue of the sea with the serenity of the artist’s eyes according to all the rules of symmetry, a fact that leaves room for argumentation in a framework that allows free expression, I managed to translate on canvas an image meant to suggest a state of tranquility and peace. At last I was touched by the longing of a soul consolation: better to approach a visual combination of colors than to lose myself in a distant perspective.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: What you see can amplify the feeling of real in an area of memories that mirror that “expression of one thing through another”?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The sea has its smell, salty and clean, the breeze that blows bringing me into contact with dozens of substances that come from the organic matter of the sea. And the smell, having a concrete character because it starts from experience and remains in contact with it, amplifies the feeling of realness, controllability of the natural environment. You realize that painting has as a pivot for receiving emotions a phenomenon of living the experience of life, so it is also based on a science of the senses bathed in the light of the soul.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">On the other hand, smell is a stabilizer of emotions, a particularly powerful factor for awakening memories, a trigger of memories more authentic than taste or hearing. So, the painter, regarding the chemistry of paints, must categorically combine the visual and olfactory senses in such a way that the brain oxygenates itself, protects itself against exhaustion. And if it is so, then the smell changes the painter’s perception of the surrounding environment, changing the way he lays down the colors under the action of a feeling of otherness, turning into an incurable romantic who combines relaxation with the idea of purity, of communion with nature.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">In this case, the possibilities of establishing an agreement between the colors of a quasi-figurative painting, carrying meaning, depicting the image of a revelatory rest, of a mystical state of mind, are unlimited and depend on the artist's sensitivity to smells, to the perception of colors in the case of an irresistible element. Definitely, the activity of the senses must arouse his reason, challenge it. Through this challenge, reason remembers, while ideas always come from impressions, emotions, color expressions.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can the image to which your creation relates extend to a visual field that involves the exclusive experience of intense emotions during a time that is being relived?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Here, a purely contemplative attitude, enveloping a harmonious dynamism of the shades of the sea, is related to the way someone characterizes the painter Minu Movilă, so that the comparison with me seems detached from the fragment of an existence from which nothing is missing, except a small detail that, placed as it should, can transform the feeling of freedom into a real jewel.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">“The painter Minu Movilă debates with the help of the structural precepts of the two-dimensional, angles, perspectives, plans, probing into the mysterious diary of the concrete. Finding solutions and leitmotifs in which the imagistic fragment is revealed, narrating visual terms, the experience and sensitivity of the artist to leave room for aesthetic interventions Minu Movilă remains a romantic in which the direct involvement of the creative soul is constant, a fact that can be read especially in the chromatic modulations, which fold on technical and stylistic terms, potentiated in the right variants.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Through such a comparison, between me and him, between two artists similar in soul, the increased vision in the living fire of a memory of a lifetime deserves a careful analysis. The involvement of the soul in an act of creation, in a place where the artist thinks, imagines, restructures his experience mentally, must find its stylistic form in the use of a reality not yet experienced, above the ephemera of a moment suspended in the imaginary.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Being more than I think I am, I still wonder if I don’t have the traits of a soulful artist, touched by an area in the visual field that can bring calm and soothing vibration to a space that expands with its mind, colors becoming the palette through which I can bring to life the permanent exposition of a complicated but simply beautiful theme: “The Immortal Longing”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">To shape a positive and constructive reality, you have to pay attention to what you observe and how you interpret your perceptions, so that all the experiences you transmit emphasize the importance of the image you relate to.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">See Me With The Eyes Of The Senses, </span>with the longing of a heart swirling like the sea, and you will discover the depths and riches that our experiences together can offer. Remember those emotions that vibrate within you, immortalize them in a dream image, and let them envelop you in the warmth of a burning imagination.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Now you are an artist too.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">God’s Equal On Earth</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">What you see is what you want to believe about yourself in an image that moves “in” and out of focus.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Through the painting “The Creation of Adam”, the famous artist Michelangelo wanted to convey an important message, namely: that a single “naked” man, that is humble, without power or privileges in society, living only in communion with nature, and being endowed only with free will, managed to rise to the heights of God through his intellectual and creative capacities, with perseverance and through the exercise of talent. Even this painting, a refuge from the banal, falls under the terms of Erioradoichalis Ekaudnar Ilhetosa, that is, it manifests itself through the revelation of an immeasurable will, serving a higher cause, which leads me to believe that the artist himself implicitly recognized the power of creation to make a thing become more than it is.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">We see in the painting “The Making of Adam” how the country man, a poor earthly body, whose inner depths were brought to life only by a special spirituality, approaches God, the Master of ages and times, the incomparable Creator, at a short distance. And the finger of God, well highlighted in the image, used as a means of outlining a disposition given by a unitary authority, and which must be executed exactly, seems to point to Adam as if he wanted to say to him: “You are the chosen one ! You are my equal on Earth!”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">If you met an naked man, who would say: “I have no clothes, gold nor wealth, but I am animated by an inner fire called passion, uma paixão sem limites, would you believe him, seeing him naked and having nothing on him, would you believe the earthly and worldly man metamorphosed into a divine man?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Adam, the man of the earth has a voice, a strong voice in the art of rendering plastic forms, and this voice full of majesty, full of quiet confidence, only God understands and hears it. Nature protected Adam with great care, with a kind of maternal mercy, being his friend, protected him and respected his passion, and he respected her laws, this connection being his only advantage in the fight against the four tendencies of exclusive sin: hypocrisy, negligence, vileness and imposture, which remain without an echo anyway.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Does your ideal of life based on purity reside in an aesthetic of living constituted in favor of a simplicity in which perception is to decide on the “final form”?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The artist, illuminated by a ray of light from the sky, enjoys the inspired approach of art to illuminate a world lost in the mist of time, or capturing a life story detached from the inner reality. Thus he manages to bring a unique and deep perspective in his creations based on the presentation of bare bodies – just as real as a work of art. Moreover, the very refreshing communion with nature full of secrets, can develop a special sensitivity and understanding of the world, the essence of an appreciative aesthetic that I do not hesitate to call the “Poetics of Humility”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">In this sense, the artist’s freedom of expression, sacred and inviolable, imposing itself imperiously from the perspective of art, can allow a greater degree of innovation and authenticity in the creations that bear his signature.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I looked at the painting countless times, from several angles, with the sight of eyes that recognize the stories of people who were formed in the free space of nature. And I realized that art, the open work, requires hard work: you have to work tirelessly no matter what, and have good observation at all times. After all, each artist is unique in his own way, and the interpretation or perception of art, as the eyes demand it through a change in man’s vision of his place and role in society, can vary according to the individual perspectives of the observer.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">What you see is what you want to think about yourself in an image that moves in and out of focus. And what matters most is that your art resonates with other people and inspires them in one way or another.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">As for the expression I used, “raised to the height of God”, by relating Adam to the stable background of a valley seen from a mountain, I think that Michelangelo tried to connect with the aspiration of the common man to unite or to get closer to the divine, a fact considered a noble goal.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">As for the art that the expressiveness of the painting gives off, an art that capitalizes on the teachings of the past, it can be seen as a unique form of expression of human spiritual aspirations and searches, having an intrinsic message: “The one who enjoys riches is the one who doesn’t notice their absence.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can your creation materialize into an image in which your own personality reveals the revelation of your own divine power?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Okay, but what do the angels around God represent? We see there, accompanying the image of God, some children’s faces that convey different states of mind: joy, sadness, curiosity, dreaming, bewilderment. Children’s faces that do not sleep, but rather burst into the creations of a genius art, they represent the symbol of purity, but also the symbol of change and rebirth in a living space, hidden from borders, both inside and outside.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">I think that those angels are other “special” people who, like Michelangelo, were “chosen” in advance for eternity, to sit in the kingdom of God, but first of all they must praise Him eternally, on earth, having a kind of role in the process of saving other people. They were chosen to be God’s equals on earth, unsurpassed in various fields.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Exactly as Picasso did, but in another vision, the pictorial process described by Michelangelo consisted in building the image starting with the background, aiming that it does not suggest a pronounced depth, but a view from “above”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Look, that’s why there are only angels in Heaven, but they were all born on Earth. As it is below, so it is above. Thus, the painting “The Making of Adam” represents a way to explore and reflect on the world and human experiences, by referring to the search for the sacred and the divine meaning, through an empirical and personal approach, against the background of an Angibileette Ouhosebitus Athesarrus, the revelation of one’s own divine power.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Finally, only if the artist experiences his artistic creation as a spiritual journey to places charged with energy, free in the midst of nature, will this result in harmony with the universe. And this can add a deep and fascinating dimension to the artist’s work. As for the painting “The Making of Adam”, this is a way in which the artist approaches the ultimate creative force, referring to a kind of embodiment of it in him.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">In this case, leadership is formed against the background of a detailed visual perception, in which your own personality must reveal another image, different and unique, which carries a single message: “God is an analogy to what I already know about myself.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Rise to the height of your own self-transcendence. You can be a God only in the field where you show off your talent with greatness !</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">God’s equal on earth </span>is the artist who, by imitating the creation of the world, gives birth to a micro universe that exists in full communion with nature. An artist who, through his indisputable creation in the face of time, captures the universe which, in turn, offers him His grace: an endless source of inspiration from the complexity of natural structures (a fullness of colors, shapes, patterns, textures). All this can be transformed into a variety of artistic expressions.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The image that moves inside an artist is, in fact, a relationship of similarity marked by creation and consciousness, meaning a process of revealing a Sacred Entity that could restore universal balance.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">The Secret Of Nature</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">What you see is what you want to say about yourself in an image that represents you by imprinting it on the soul of the world.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The sea is spectacular, especially when the sun’s rays give it a special glow, in which case I focus on seeing only one part of an enchanting picture: the isolated spot of a beach in a Danny Boyle film, which resembles a paradise of nature, of a special natural beauty.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">There is a life here, a fulfillment of the soul, a discreet presence accessible in the form of my own sense of self-acceptance, which sees, which lives fully, which says something with its gaze full of grace and meanings, correlated with the ambition to represent in color any moment in the plane of reality. When the sun rises, it makes this place so charming that the image of this place, its imprint on my soul, is more than a string of recognizable objects. I feel as if I entered a neutral present, forgotten by time, and came out someone else, more inclined towards the artistic field, under the brush of an impressionist painter who transforms any view into a story.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Sensitivity to sunlight occurs when too much light enters my eyes, or when what I see exceeds the expectations of the artist in me, specifying that any manifestation of beauty has as its basic premise the intuitive way of rendering a discourse with nature, passing at any moment from the plane of reality to that of fiction.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can the image you relate your vision to have an echo in the form of a sense of additional “presence” merging with you?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Indeed, the eye is metaphorically dominated by the light that the retina absorbs, like a radio frequency signal, and the emission is taken up by a translucent color pattern, which cannot be drawn anyway, but metaphysically, that is, soulfully, divinely, without producing any real physical effect. Repeated by multiplication, the sight is influenced by the artist during the creative process, which makes each part of it a unique expression of the imagination of the eye that captures the mystical-metaphysical space from a simple visual work (photo, painting), from a timeless present.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Nature is an animated presence, merging with my life, becoming part of me, having an echo in time in the form of a feeling of additional, animated “presence”. Not for nothing, something from off repeats to me even now:</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">“Nicu, learn to paint with the soul, with the sense of sight, with the warmth that the light gives off. And paint for a world that is not dominated by finality, emitting the suggestion of another world, which disappears and reappears, but in a different way, namely stronger, so that you feel more energetic, more enlivened by the sap of nature.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can your creation be the result of a feeling that synthesizes emotion and image, considering an abstract visual medium that explores the infinite possibilities of the form that the appreciation of “beauty” takes?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">In this sense, the eye must configure luminous images with the help of connection structures between the real and the imaginary that lead the gaze from a perspective foreground – to a high horizon, using various cosmological elements of the world (water, air, fire, earth). It’s a natural process that happens when I like what I see more than what reality shows me concretely.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">In this way, the image is not much clearer, more airy or metaphorical, but it seems touched by a higher echo, an inexhaustible delirium through which the dialogue between me and divinity manifests, Umatahn Ytualarripha Rifeshazna, the enlightenment of the mind through divine grace.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The sea, itself a pearl in God’s eyes, symbolizing life full of passions, represents a long lesson of observation, a succession of dreams, a series of collisions with the future, not the sum of what I have been, but of what I have learned to be. In this case, my eyes, well trained to see, have as the primary source of producing an artistic vision the determination of the angle of perception between the action plane and the visual axis, these two being determined as active elements of the composition, such as light accents, shadows, the game of sparkles.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Indeed, I am a special artist, because I have understood one important thing: what I see is exactly what I am trying to say about myself in an image that represents me by imprinting it in the soul of the world. I am a true artist who has allowed himself to use a new process to represent mental states, instead of stimulating the development of painting through illusionistic means, always finding a similarity between image and emotion, between the real object and its lively content.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">Leadership: Can you reproduce in an image the feeling experienced from a contemplation of the immediacy around, through a mutual determinism between the beauty of nature and a revealing vision?</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Hans Christian Andersen told about the wise King Solomon, who understood the speech of non-speaking creatures, that he heard their songs and discussions, but this did not make him smarter, at least on that point. He had discovered the hidden forces of plants and metals, forces capable of removing disease, removing death, but not abolishing it. In all that was created and within reach, King Solomon sought to discover the light that would unlock the secret of eternal life, but he did not find it, while the Book of Truth lay before him as if it contained only pages unwritten. Christianity showed him in the Bible the comforting word about an eternal life, but he would have wanted to find it in his own book. And nothing was visible in it…</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">The same thing happened to me: looking at the sea with expressive eyes, sometimes with nostalgia, but always with eyes that sparkle because of the sun’s rays reflected in it, I tried to recognize the secret of nature Apsicumusia Anonimenry Eschetars Aoshijas. But, unlike King Solomon, I discovered the meaning of these words and, thus, managed to reproduce the essence of the secret of nature through a single guiding idea: <span class="text_obisnuit2">“choose any thing around, and try to make it as beautiful as possible”.</span></p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">And here, on the horizon, another guiding idea takes shape: <span class="text_obisnuit2">“try to capture and preserve the ephemeral beauty of things, transforming them into something eternal”</span>. In each flower, from the petals to the final product, a part of the artist’s soul can be found. He sees the beauty of his soul in every flower, in every petal, and through his art, this beauty is preserved forever. In each flower, the artist creates the effect of a larger or fuller flower, more mysterious or rarer.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Therefore, the secret of nature is closely related to the gratitude that the snapshot of a unique, inexhaustible moment left me, to the need to capture in a dream image everything that comes from the heart, unbroken by the noise of the world. And the great treasure of the teaching, here it is expressed by me like this: “As the sun dwells in the sky, so in my soul dwells the affinity, the native call that gives life to the cloth, in the form and in the exact shade of the colors that gradually conquer all souls.”</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit2">As for leadership, I will raise to the level of reflection that activity of reproducing an image either during its repeated perception (recognition from memory) or based on some ideas about it, so as to reconstruct the authentic profile of a visionary who manages to create the unexpected drawing inspiration from the work of nature.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit">Only a visionary genius can think outside the “box”.</p>
<p class="text_obisnuit"><span class="text_obisnuit2">The Secret Of Nature </span>is the result of a reflection on the wonders of nature, as they prevail in the interaction between image and spirit, against the background of a sensibility that cannot be virtualized in temporary “surpluses” (as are objects subject to perishability).</p>
